parupkaar.org is an non-profit organization with the aim to provide volunteers to help anyone.
We will provide a platform where altruist meets the needy. Our main motive is to
help the masses without any inconsiderate motives.

Everyone who wishes to contribute something towards the humanity is our intended audience. We wish to give a chance to anyone who wants to help any NGO but doesn’t know how to do so. Also, the people who can’t donate something but wish to be a volunteer is our intended audience.


An open-source project is basically a map where volunteers will get own profile and the people who wants to donate anything but don’t have time to do so, can help via volunteers. Volunteers will be live on map and can reach out to public in there area to donate whatever they can and help needy one’s. Once well established the project has scope to help people at international level.

Parupkaar.org will let volunteers create their profile and will connect them to others.
By letting people see location of volunteers in a particular area, a connection will be established so that needy people can be helped.
