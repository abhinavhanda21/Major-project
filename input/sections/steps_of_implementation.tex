\section{Steps of Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The first thing that needs to be done is configure Map tile and osm data with django framework. 
	\item After that we need to let any volunteer create a unique profile which will be shown on map.
	\item Routing will come into action after profile is created. Routing will connect volunteers to donators.
	\item After going through all of this our objective will be meet.
\end{itemize}
